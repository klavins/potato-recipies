- [Amlogic Web Page](https://www.amlogic.com/) Lists lots of other chips, like the [S922X](https://www.amlogic.com/#Products/394/index.html) and the [A311D2](https://www.amlogic.com/#Products/393/index.html) that seem to be newer than Le Potato's chip. There are even [single board computers](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Supports-Interfaces-Bluetooth-MaliG52MP8/dp/B09ZTLLZLZ?th=1) for these chips.

- [Overview Article](https://www.cnx-software.com/2016/01/12/amlogic-s905x-processor-specifications/): This is old, suggesting the chip is likely being deprecated and will be replaced by a newer line soon (if not already)
